# Object Comparison

## Features

- Automatically compare objects as values are entered
- Dark theme by default with a toggle to switch between dark and light themes

## How to use

1. Open the SPA in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter JSON objects in the two text areas provided. The objects should be formatted correctly as valid JSON.
